Hello, and welcome to my RESTful API, using MongoDB

You can check the status of the app at https://restful-api-lulz.herokuapp.com/api
If app is currently running it will display a message that the API is working.

You can use an API platform like Postman or Insomnia to deliver GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests

https://restful-api-lulz.herokuapp.com/api/lulz
will display all of the Lulz in our MongoDB database.
You can use this link for GET and POST routes.
GET at this address will get all Lulz.
POST at this database using a x-www-form-urlencoded key value pair of name: Lulz-name

Finally, if you navigate to https://restful-api-lulz.herokuapp.com/api/lulz/:lulz_id
you can make GET requests for a single lulz,
you can make PUT requests to change the name of the lulz
and you can delete that lulz.

Thanks for taking the time to view my project!
